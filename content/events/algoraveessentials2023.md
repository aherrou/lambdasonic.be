Nerdlab en Luca School of Arts join forces to give this short course on Live Coding thought by Kasper Jordaens aka kaotec []<>

In a series of 5 evening classes we go from zero-to-hero with tools to generate image and sound through code. We will immerse ourselves in the culture of live coding and learn how to use it in our own practice as a tool to test ideas while learning about the strengths and weaknesses of computers.

Discover the many possibilities of live coding in your artistic practice and get hands-on with it.
