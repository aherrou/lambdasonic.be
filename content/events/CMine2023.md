imgcap: AI visuals


Kaotec did a livecoding performance at C-Mine LUCA School of Arts for the filmEU summit. 
Not only the music was livecoded, the visuals where live prompted in a continuous stream of AI generated images. Instead of making live music to a silent movie, a movie was generated for a soundtrack.

Chronosynth is a live coding performance where both audio and image are created on the spot. The audio is made in a tidalcycles live coding environment with the help of some external instruments (like the [TUNP](https://www.kaotec.be/data/tunp/)).
The images are an infinite panorama created by Stable Diffusion and live prompting using a custom web interface. The images are stitched into an infinite panorama using a process of automated outpainting that was developed at kaotec during a summer internship with [Floor](https://www.instagram.com/fl00r99/)
