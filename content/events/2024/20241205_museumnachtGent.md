Six Lambdasonic coders performed in an iconic setting of the center arena of the circus during 'museumnacht', where the backdrop of the music was a curated collection of objects from the then closed for renovation Design Museum Ghent. The objects from the collection, selected by each artist was transformed by AI in the 'lost in diffusion' work by Kasper Jordaens (also performing as kaotec) and sequenced on the beats of the music.
