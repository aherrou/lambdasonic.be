Monday kaotec [Kasper Jordaens (BE)] will bring a livecoding performance using his analog inference box (AI box), a hybrid analog/digital computer that will be live patched (modular synthesis) and combined with livecoding on a laptop for music and visuals. The AI box is a musical instrument being designed to perform some functions automatic, but the analog synth makes this more organic than a classic computer. It‚Äôs a portable lab where kaotec experiments with sound and live performance. Kasper is part of Lambdasonic, a live coding collective from Belgium that regularly perform at algoraves. Algoraves are events where the music is created using live programming algorithms. The code is projected so the audience can follow whats happening (even without knowing how to code) the structure of the music is presented a visuals, often reacting to the audio itself. People are allowed to dance and ignore the code üôÇ
