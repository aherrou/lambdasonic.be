Lorenzo Serasini (oz.n.roll) is a musician born in Ravenna, Italy, now living in Belgium.

Bassist in the collective Orange Combutta (Irma Records, Bologna), he then moved to Belgium to study electronic music at the Antwerpâ€™s Conservatory. He takes his inspiration from the underground electronic music scene and explores how to build a bridge between analog machines and coding in a tight live set of electro and raw techno.
