# KAOTEC []<>

Kaotec (Kasper Jordaens) is a Belgian artist and live coder creating visuals, music and
installations. In 2014 he co-founded LambdaSonic as a Belgian Live Coding label and he
started live coding himself as a part of H.AL.I.C. where he did visuals. In the past years
Kasper has been experimenting with the modular synth and from there (modular) sound
design became part of his live coding music. He likes to build his own instruments in both
hard- and software and teaches livecode (visual + music) at LUCA school of arts in Ghent.
More recently, as part of BotBop livecoding is combined with AI and a string quartet to
deliver a fresh sound with classical instruments and a data visualisation.
