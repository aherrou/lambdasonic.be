Andrew’s musical work is quite difficult to pinpoint. Ranging from his early progressive hard tech outfit (Monastic Project) in 1999, free jazz explorations (Chaos of the Haunted Spire) from 2005, electric saxophone driven fusion of the band STUFF. in 2012, electronic live music moniker ‘Internal Sun’ from 2013, the space inflicted dubjazz of Stellar Legions in 2022 and his sound healing biodata audiovisual meditation music of Plant Based Music (2023), Andrew’s musical world recently covers new ground with the advent of Live Coding. Primarily using Bespoke Synthesizer as his weapon for mass production of coded music, Python is the snake that finally seduced this musician pur sang to drop his instruments in favour of plain text. Currently working on AI music systems with Lambda Sonic’s own BotBop live coding band, together with Kaotec and Sondervan.

His mind boggling eclecticism finds a warm and restful place in his long standing encompassing world view: 

Unity in Diversity. It’s not the style, not the tool, not the complexity, it’s the intention: serving the One.
