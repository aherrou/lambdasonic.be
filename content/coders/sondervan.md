Dago Sondervan is a guest-professor at the conservatoire of Antwerp, at the live electronics department, teaching live coding with Sonic Pi and TidalCycles. He graduated as a jazz-drummer in 1991, and entered the electronic music scene DJ-ing in legendary clubs like “Fuse” in Brussels. He also toured around the globe as a drummer with bands like “Think of One”(Best “crossing border” band award from the BBC in 2007), Trixie Withley, Nivie Nielsen and the Deer Children, etc. Releasing records using the monikers “Anton Price” and “Bohrbug”, he used Atari computers with generative software to create his tracks. He started programming his compositions in Symbolic Composer, a musical language based on Common Lisp, in 2002. It was from then on his dream to improvise live, using this technique. In 2010, he got in touch with the live coding scene, and found a community that seemed the answer to this longing. Dago is co-founder of Lambdasonic.
