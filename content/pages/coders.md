Lambdasonic is a group of live coders, some do only music, some do only visuals, some do both. But all are great people with a shared interest in creating fun raves together. All coding languages and styles blend together in a geeky vibe where everyone is welcome to learn from one another. The coders organise events themselves or with some help.
