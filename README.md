need a file per event in /content/events 

## howto contribute content using a pull request

sounds harder than it is, more info 
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

### some points of attention
- Allow edits from maintainers.
- send a message to the lambdasonic maintainer so they know they have to merge something

## directly contribute content (without a fork, requires repo access)

### to add an event
1. got to the /content/events directory
2. select the event you want to use as a template
3. copy text the code view
4. add a new file, name your file *title.md* remember where title must be unique and the same as the title in the  metadata from the next step
5. edit the event, make sure to change the metadata on top of the file, especially use a unique title and slug
6. upload images with the correct filename to /content/images, make sure there is at least one image with the same name is the image: metadata field
7. notify the lambdasonic maintainer, who will deploy the changes
